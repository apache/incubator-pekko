Apache Pekko
============

Apache Pekko is an open-source framework for building applications that are concurrent, distributed, resilient and elastic.
Pekko uses the Actor Model to provide more intuitive high-level abstractions for concurrency.
Using these abstractions, Pekko also provides libraries for persistence, streams, HTTP, and more.

Pekko is a fork of [Akka](https://github.com/akka/akka) 2.6.x, prior to the Akka project's adoption of the Business Source License.
