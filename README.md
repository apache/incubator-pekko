Apache Pekko is an open-source framework for building applications that are concurrent, distributed, resilient and elastic.
Pekko uses the Actor Model to provide more intuitive high-level abstractions for concurrency.
Using these abstractions, Pekko also provides libraries for persistence, streams, HTTP, and more.

Pekko is a fork of [Akka](https://github.com/akka/akka) 2.6.x, prior to the Akka project's adoption of the Business Source License.

- Make sure you have [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) installed and using this JDK.
- Make sure you also have Java 8 installed (JDK or JRE).
- Use git to clone the [repo](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pekko) or download a source release from https://pekko.apache.org
- Open a command window and change directory to the directory where you installed the source
- `sbt compile` compiles the main source for project default version of Scala (2.13)
    - `sbt +compile` will compile for all supported versions of Scala
- `sbt test` will compile the code and run the unit tests
- `sbt package` will build the jars
    - the jars will built into target dirs of the various modules
    - for the the 'actor' module, the jar will be built to `actor/target/scala-2.13/`
- `sbt publishLocal` will push the jars to your local Apache Ivy repository
- `sbt publishM2` will push the jars to your local Apache Maven repository
- `sbt docs/paradox` will build the docs (the ones describing the module features)
     - Requires Java 11 minimum
     - `sbt docs/paradoxBrowse` does the same but will open the docs in your browser when complete
     - the `index.html` file will appear in `target/paradox/site/main/`
- `sbt unidoc` will build the Javadocs for all the modules and load them to one place
     - the `index.html` file will appear in `target/scala-2.13/unidoc/`
